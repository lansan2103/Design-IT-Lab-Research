R/D Highlights:

1. Built a narrow agentic AI that interprets user queries and autonomously summarizes neighborhood “vibes” using multi-step reasoning.

2. Applied BERT-based sentiment analysis to Google Places reviews to quantify public perception of local areas.

3. Used LangGraph to orchestrate a structured, stateful workflow for tool-augmented data processing and summarization.

4. Generated natural-language neighborhood summaries using statistical insights and Gemini-generated cultural context.

5. Deployed the system via a Flask API, enabling integration with frontend interfaces and external AI agents.
